### Sambar Rice is my favourite food
Sambar Rice is my favourite dish because of its rich flavours, it is a fusion of variety of spices with **Dal** and **Basmati rice**. Its a combination of various spieces to give it a hot spicy flavour.
The basmati rice addes more flavours to the dal and spices. It's one of the famous dishes of Hyderabad.
